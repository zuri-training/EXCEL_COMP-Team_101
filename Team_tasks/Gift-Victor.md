ðŸ˜‰ Here are the [resolved issues](https://github.com/zuri-training/EXCEL_COMP-Team_101/issues?q=assignee%3AGift-Victor+is%3Aclosed) (and all issues assigned to me).

> Just in case you'll want to see the actual files/documents. Here they are.

1. **Understanding the brief**: The team had to research the product and its target users. I took part in the brainstorming and [research plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IL0Q5_j2FnKZR8Ny3pv-8h0nyWSlxzof9FuBrDZUWnQ/edit?usp=sharing).

2. **Research Phase**: The survey method was used to gather data and we did research on possible users, and competitors. A moodboard of competitors' designs was created and analysed. All information obtained was then summarised, proofread and edited for the [project documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HjF1Dk0OlxHLxSltrga9uxH12cKEfUqXdyKtW1WWQAs/edit?usp=sharing).

3. **Analyse**: In this stage, I did the user flow which can be found in our [user research](https://www.figma.com/file/res4sdWmcEBbOehYEF56al/User-research%2Fflow?node-id=0%3A1) Figjam file. 

4. **Design**: I did the [digital sketches](https://www.figma.com/file/UV7dpsrV768tBbfFN8eWsz/simpliXL?node-id=2%3A2), designed the [tour screens](https://www.figma.com/file/UV7dpsrV768tBbfFN8eWsz/simpliXL?node-id=2738%3A35968) (explore feature) and modified some of the designs. The [style guide](https://www.figma.com/file/UV7dpsrV768tBbfFN8eWsz/simpliXL?node-id=0%3A1) was also done to suit the project. 

5. **Implementation**: [Prototypes](https://www.figma.com/file/UV7dpsrV768tBbfFN8eWsz/simpliXL?node-id=2%3A2) were done to show the flow of the app and I checked for functionalities. Screens were made to be [responsive](https://www.figma.com/file/UV7dpsrV768tBbfFN8eWsz/simpliXL?node-id=3007%3A57294) by using autolayouts and constraints in Figma.

6. **Evaluation**: The [design documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JyFCwnTNvq4w8unjJTeqhAB9gXs-PpF-1cLrWa09D7M/edit?usp=sharing) is ready though not as detailed as we'd like but it explains our project, design process and contains the relevant design documents.
